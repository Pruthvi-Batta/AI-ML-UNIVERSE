# Timer Class Documentation

## Overview

The `Timer` class provides a utility for measuring and logging the execution time of functions.

## Classes

### Timer

A utility class for timing function executions.

#### Static Methods

##### time_wrapper

```python
@staticmethod
def time_wrapper(func)
```

A decorator method that wraps a function to measure and print its execution time.

**Parameters**
----------
func : callable
    The function to be timed and executed.

**Returns**
----------
callable
    A wrapped version of the input function that prints execution time.

**Notes**
--------
- This decorator prints the function name before and after execution.
- Execution time is calculated and printed to 4 decimal places.
- The original function's return value is preserved.

**Examples**
-----------
```python
@Timer.time_wrapper
def example_function():
    # Function implementation
    pass

# When called, this will print execution details
example_function()
```

**Raises**
---------
No specific exceptions are raised by this method.

**Warning**
----------
- This decorator adds overhead to function execution due to timing logic.
- Recommended for development and debugging, not for production performance-critical code.
