Prompt:
-------
I have a parallelogram ABCD with Side AB as 10cm and a perimeter of the parallelogram is 18cm.
What is the length of the side BC?

Response:
---------
The perimeter of a parallelogram is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2(\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]

Given:
- Side **AB = 10 cm**
- Perimeter **= 18 cm**

Let **BC = x** (since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, **AB = CD** and **BC = DA**).

\[
2(10 + x) = 18
\]

\[
10 + x = 9
\]

\[
x = 9 - 10
\]

\[
x = -1 \quad (\text{which is not possible})
\]

Since the perimeter should be greater than twice any single side length, there might be an issue with the given perimeter value. Please recheck the problem statement.

Prompt:
-------
I have a parallelogram ABCD where AB is parallel to CD. Side AB is 10cm and a area of the parallelogram is 100cm². We draw a circle, which have points P and Q on it. If P lies on extended AB and and Q lies on extended CD (Assume extended in same direction), then what is the area of the circle?

Response:
---------
We are given a parallelogram \( ABCD \) where:
- \( AB \parallel CD \)
- \( AB = 10 \) cm
- Area of the parallelogram = 100 cm²

### Step 1: Find the Height of the Parallelogram
The area of a parallelogram is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
\]

Since \( AB = 10 \) cm is the base,

\[
100 = 10 \times \text{Height}
\]

\[
\text{Height} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 2: Find the Diameter of the Circle
We draw a circle passing through points \( P \) and \( Q \), where:
- \( P \) lies on the extended \( AB \)
- \( Q \) lies on the extended \( CD \)
- The extension is in the **same direction**, meaning \( PQ \) is twice the height of the parallelogram.

Thus, the diameter of the circle is:

\[
PQ = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 3: Find the Area of the Circle
The radius \( r \) of the circle is:

\[
r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ cm}
\]

The area of the circle is:

\[
\pi r^2 = \pi (10)^2 = 100\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\mathbf{100\pi \text{ cm}^2}
\]
