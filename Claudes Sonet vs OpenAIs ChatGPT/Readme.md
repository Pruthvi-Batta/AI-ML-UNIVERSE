Every day, we see that AI models are evolving fast. Choosing the right one can make all the difference. Today, we're diving into LLM model comparison (ChatGPT vs Claude) to help you understand each model's strengths and weaknesses.
Before investing in an AI model, we have to know what works best for our needs. Stay informed and make the right choice!

 - Complex coding needs (Short code formats with advanced syntax needs, Longer code generation capabilities using OOPs capabilities)
 - Code understanding (Documentation, debugging and optimising code)
 - Math reasoning capabalities
 - General reasoning capabilities
 - General data relations

We have segregated the LLM responses into folders and saved them here. To read the full summary head to our [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@aimluniverse/claudes-sonet-vs-openai-s-chatgpt-0a656a5063c6).
